## The Open Knowledge Logo

This is the (new) Open Knowledge logo.

![The Open Knowledge Logo](http://assets.okfn.org/p/okfn/img/okfn-logo-portrait.png)

Our new symbol is based on the data contained in one of our key projects &mdash; The Open Data Index. The 70 'spokes' represent the 70 countries in the survey. The countries are spun alphabetically and the colour bars show how open (green) or closed (red) they are, echoing the colour scheme of the source website.

The symbol is designed to work on several levels: it's derived from data; it's an 'O' so acts as shorthand for 'open'; it's a symbol of the earth that echoes our global footprint. We call it our 'data earth'.

To 'recreate' the Open Knowledge brand look you need:

* [font - typeface (the letters we use in literature/Web we publish)](https://github.com/okfn/ok-media/tree/master/typography/)
* [brand colours](https://docs.google.com/a/okfn.org/document/d/1cpPtPEN577HPUDDfq8kP5eyeE5Pon8mnQoE4bVcNN7Y/)
* logos in this repository

### Wonder which logo to use where?

* For **Web** and in **electronic documents**, please use **RGB** colour .png files.
* For **print** use, please use **CMYK** colour .eps files.

### These are the versions of the logo we use:

* **Black** - to be used on backgrounds or in situations where the colour one would look bad.
* **White** (against background) - this can be used against black or colour backgrounds.
* **Colour** - the all colour version is the 'preferred' version to use where possible. Please use RGB for screen use, CMYK for print so the colours display correctly.

### When changing the size of logos, please never change the width-height proportions!
Do NOT 'shrink' the logo to any smaller than these recommended sizes:

* Large to medium use logo
  Minimum size - 40mm/110px (height)
* Small use logo
  Minimum size -  20mm/60px (height)

_**Please also do not ‘hack’ the logo and change its colours or shape.  
If you have creative ideas how to work with this, please talk to Susanne or Naomi so we’re in the loop.**_

### Using the logo so small it would not display properly?

The [extra small use icons](https://github.com/okfn/ok-media/tree/master/graphics/extra-small-icons/) can be used as an icon for digital applications and should never be used at a size larger than 45px. This version of the logo is perfect for favicons and app icons.  
If you need to use the logo in a small space, there is [a version with less detail](https://github.com/okfn/ok-media/tree/master/graphics/small-logos/), so it looks crisper.

### Logos for Local Groups and Working Groups

We have created 'new style' logos for all local groups (including incorporated Chapters) and working groups. If you want to update your style to the new look, there is a full set of logos for Web and print use for each local and working group.

For the [working groups](https://github.com/okfn/ok-media/tree/master/graphics/working-group-logos/), we have also 'redrawn' the graphic icons used for each group, they are in the respective folders and ready for your use.

**If your group has any questions, needs any amendments, or wants to check anything how you can make the 'new brand' work for your group, please contact Susanne (email: susanne.kendler@okfn.org) or someone else in the network team (like Christian or Katelyn) who are happy to have a chat.**

**Please also do not change the colours of the logos, we’re aiming for consistency!  
Thank you :).**

In connection with the logo - please use Open Knowledge colours. [Guidelines here](https://docs.google.com/a/okfn.org/document/d/1cpPtPEN577HPUDDfq8kP5eyeE5Pon8mnQoE4bVcNN7Y/).
