## Open Knowledge Typography

As with our logo and colour swatches, a consistent use of typography reinforces the Open Knowledge identity. Our typeface is [Lato](http://www.latofonts.com/lato-free-fonts/), which is a free, open source font that can be easily downloaded by anyone working or volunteering for Open Knowledge. The typeface comes in a range of weights but the most common weights we use are **Lato Black**, **Lato Semibold** and **Lato Regular**.

You can download the font from the [official website](http://www.latofonts.com/lato-free-fonts/) for the complete font packs, or just download the relevant font in Black, Semibold and Regular from this repository.

If you have not downloaded / installed Lato on your machine, please use **Arial** as a substitute, and a **Sans Serif** font for Web/email communications if Arial is not available.

On some machines you may encounter display issues with some versions of Lato, if that is the case, please use a substitute font, ideally Arial.

**Where possible, please use Lato (or Arial) 10/12 as a standard for documents.**

You can find details about downloading/installing the font, and the recommended versions [here](https://docs.google.com/a/okfn.org/document/d/1k_QZTbFtgMcYx1LrFESgsyXzbP5fFFvp2UjPm3w0yAA/).

In printed publications, headlines should be set in Lato black or semibold using all caps (plus optical kerning and +175 tracking if using Adobe InDesign or Illustrator). You can also use a bold colour from the [colour palette](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cpPtPEN577HPUDDfq8kP5eyeE5Pon8mnQoE4bVcNN7Y/) to create further standout.

Body text should be set in Lato Regular (using optical kerning and +10 tracking if using InDesign). Please regularly use the dark grey from the colour palette for large amounts of body text.

The older ver­sion (1.0) of the Lato font fam­ily is avail­able on [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Lato). Using this ser­vice, you can eas­ily incor­po­rate the Lato fonts into your web­site. Soon, the new 2.0 ver­sion will be avail­able on Google Fonts as well. You can also download the webfonts from the [official website](http://www.latofonts.com/lato-free-fonts/) for the complete font packs, or just download the relevant font in Black, Semibold and Regular from this repository.
