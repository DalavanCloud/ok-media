# Open Knowledge Media Resources

Here we keep "some" of our media assets, especially those like the main logos. You can find a discussion about what sorts of media assets this repository should keep [here](https://discuss.okfn.org/t/make-new-logo-available-as-svg-on-wiki-okfn-org/152/14).

*Note: This repository uses [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/) so you should first download and install the Git command line extension before cloning.*

## Brand Essentials

You can find [KEY MESSAGES](https://docs.google.com/a/okfn.org/document/d/1Dt9w3yFi9GagWWUlP5cv9Zxw6255f7L206ZoWwOQsvw/) we use at Open Knowledge International to describe our work below. Local groups and working groups will each have their own circumstances and communities, so will have additional/other key messages to describe their work in more detail. We all work on open data and open knowledge, but of course there is a variety of individual, regional, cultural, specialist differences in our community. The purpose of the core brand messages is not to make everyone talk like one, just to summarize our work as well as possible and reflect our diversity.

### Our Narrative

#### Open Knowledge - Core Purpose
 
A world where knowledge creates power for the many, not the few. A world where data FREES us – to make informed choices about how we live, what we buy and who gets our vote. A world where information and insights are accessible – and apparent – to everyone. This is the world we choose.

#### Open Knowledge - Why We Do What We Do

A revolution in technology is happening and it’s changing everything we do.

* Never before has so much data been collected and analysed. Never before have so many people had the ability to freely, easily and quickly share information across the globe.
* Governments and corporations are using this data to create knowledge about our world, and make decisions about our future.
* But who should control this data and the ability to find insights and make decisions?
* The many, or the few? This is a choice that we get to make. The future is up for grabs.
* Do we want to live in a world where access to knowledge is “closed”, and the power and understanding it brings is controlled by the few? Or, do we choose a world where
* knowledge is “open” and we are all empowered to make informed choices about our future?
* We believe that knowledge should be open, and that everyone – from citizens to scientists, from enterprises to entrepreneurs, – should have access to the information they need to understand and shape the world around them.

#### Open Knowledge - The What and The How

Since 2004 we have been the organisation opening up data across the world. We do this through being:

* Technology pioneers: We built and now maintain the leading open source data platform, CKAN, that is used by governments globally, and allows anyone to easily store, explore and distribute data
* All-round experts: As experts in both the technical and strategic aspects of opening up data we offer help and consultancy advice to governments keen to open their data, to NGOs on how to use data to create change, and to anyone else keen to turn data into knowledge.
* Network leaders: We are at the centre of a worldwide network of thousands of people who care about openness and we use this network to inspire and support both our practical and advocacy work.
* Data makers: Through practical projects, research and collaborations, such as where does my money go?, OpenSpending and Europe’s Energy, we explore how data can be used and demonstrate what it can do
* Thought leaders and campaigners: Using our day-to-day experience we identify the
* barriers to opening data and opportunities for data use, and use these as a basis to
* campaign and advocate for greater openness. Our Open Data Index sets out the state of openness worldwide and we contributed to the formation of the G8 Open Data Charter.
* Knowledge sharers: We know knowledge is power so we work hard to teach people what open data is and how they can use it best. Through bespoke training courses, our School of Data, our Open Data and Data Journalism Handbooks, and a whole series of events,
* conferences and festivals we empower people to seek the answers to questions that matter.

### Open Knowledge Colours
