# Open Knowledge Media Resources

Here we keep "some" of our media assets, especially those like the main logos. You can find discussions about what sorts of media assets this repository should keep [here](https://discuss.okfn.org/t/make-new-logo-available-as-svg-on-wiki-okfn-org/152/14).

*Note: This repository uses [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/) so you should first download and install the Git command line extension before cloning.*
